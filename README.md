# pokedex
Pokedex is an application used to search pokemons with their names. It is build using frontend web development. 
If you’re on your journey to be a Pokémon master, nothing is going to be more useful than a Pokédex that allows you to identify and learn more about each Pokémon. 
So this project allows you to search about each pokémon's ability and strength.
