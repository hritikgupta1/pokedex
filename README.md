# pokedex
Pokedex is an application used to search pokemons with their names. It is build using frontend web development. 
If you’re on your journey to be a Pokémon master, nothing is going to be more useful than a Pokédex that allows you to identify and learn more about each Pokémon. 
So this project allows you to search about each pokémon's ability and strength.
This project is responsive in nature. 
*NOTE: Please enter all the names correctly spelled as well as in small letters in the search bar.Thank you
